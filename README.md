# MLCourse-2324

Material for the course "Big Data Science and Machine Learning" of the academic year 2023-2024 for the Graduate Program in Physics of the 
University of Turin, held on Nov. 18-22, 2024. 

## Pre-requisites

- Basic knowledge of python 

## Before the course starts

- We will be using python, in particular I advise you to get familiar with Jupyter notebooks, numpy and pandas before the course starts. No expert knowledge is required, but doing a couple of tutorials on these topics (easily found on the web) is highly recommended.
- We will use github for authentication on JupyterHub. 
  - Please send us your github account. 
  - The username should not contain any special character, such as -, _, ., etc. 
  - If it does, please create a new account that fulfills the requirements.

## Practicalities

- The course will be held on site, and it will not be possible to attend remotely. To pass the course you need to follow 80% of the lessons and pass the final test.
- Every day we will have a mixture of theoretical and hands-on sessions. The last day we will have only hands-on with exercises, which will also be the test for those who needs to get CFU credits.

## Schedule:

UPDATE
- Nov 18th-22nd, for two hours/day, 10-12 - Aula Wataghin (except for Nov. 19th when we'll be in Aula Fubini at 14:00-16:00)
- The exam will be on Nov 25 (but can be turned in up to Dec 10th)


## Hands-on session

- you will need to authenticate through your GitHub account (please read [this](#before-the-course-starts) first)
- on the first day, open a terminal and clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Course-bigDataAndML/MLCourse-2324.git
```
- The Jupyter notebook documentation can be found [here](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html)
